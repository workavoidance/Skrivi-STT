# Microsoft Store distribution

Skrivi Snakk's Microsoft Store product identity is:

- Store ID: `9P42NBXD8W36`
- Package name: `Skrivi.Skrivi`
- Publisher: `CN=EF3D997F-87B2-4AD0-B65B-877EE1632E65`
- Publisher display name: `Skrivi`

The Store package is an additional distribution channel. The existing Inno
Setup installer and portable archive remain the primary GitHub release assets.
A failure or delay in Store packaging or certification must not block their
publication.

## First submission

1. Let the release workflow build the unsigned `.msix` artifact.
2. Download the `Skrivi-<version>-Microsoft-Store` artifact from the workflow
   run.
3. In Partner Center, open Skrivi Snakk and start an MSIX submission.
4. Complete pricing, availability, properties, age ratings, Store listings and
   submission options.
5. Upload the `.msix` from the workflow artifact and submit it for
   certification.

Microsoft signs the package after certification. Do not publish the unsigned
workflow artifact as a direct download: it is intended only for Partner Center.

Before each public submission, verify microphone capture, global push-to-talk,
text insertion, model download, settings persistence and automatic startup from
an installed Store package. The Store package declares a `windows.startupTask`
and Skrivi Snakk controls it through Windows' packaged `StartupTask` API. Users and
organisation policies remain able to control Skrivi Snakk through Windows Startup
settings. Also avoid installing the Store and website editions together; they
are separate installations and may keep separate application data.

After the first submission is accepted, automate future free-app updates with
the Microsoft Store Developer CLI. Store credentials belong in GitHub Actions
secrets and must never be committed to this repository.

The public Store page will use:
