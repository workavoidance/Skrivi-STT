# Settings storage

Skrivi Snakk's settings layer is independent of the current and future user-interface
frameworks. It uses only the Python standard library and can be exercised in
unit tests without Windows audio, global hotkeys, Whisper, or PySide6.

## Locations

Normal user settings are stored at:

```text
%APPDATA%\Skrivi\settings.json
```

Development builds use a separate file:

```text
%APPDATA%\Skrivi\development\settings.json
```

On the first renamed build, Skrivi Snakk moves an existing `%APPDATA%\Bragi`
directory to `%APPDATA%\Skrivi` with a same-volume directory rename. This
preserves both normal and development settings. If Windows temporarily prevents
the rename, Skrivi Snakk continues using the existing directory rather than starting
with empty settings.

Downloaded models remain separately stored under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Skrivi\models`. Settings contain model identifiers, never model
data.

## Version 7 schema

```json
{
  "schema_version": 7,
  "language": "auto",
  "model": "small",
  "hotkey": "right_ctrl",
  "microphone": "windows_default",
  "overlay_enabled": true,
  "interface_language": "auto",
  "start_with_system": false
}
```

The defaults preserve Skrivi Snakk's existing behaviour. Supported language values
are `auto`, `no`, and `en`. Automatic compares only Norwegian and English for
each recording, then uses the better match for the complete transcription.
Very short recordings may not contain enough speech for reliable detection.

Supported interface-language values are `auto`, `en`, and `nb`. Automatic uses
the Windows display language when it is Norwegian and otherwise uses English.
Users can explicitly select English or Norwegian Bokmål in Settings. An
interface-language change updates the open Settings window, tray, overlay, and
model status immediately. Cancel restores the previously saved language, while
Save persists the previewed choice.

`start_with_system` records the user's platform-neutral automatic-startup
choice. The Windows platform service applies it to the current user's Run
entry. It is disabled by default, needs no administrator rights, and is
unavailable during source development so a Python development process is never
registered accidentally.

Supported push-to-talk identifiers are `right_ctrl`, `left_ctrl_windows`,
`left_ctrl_left_alt`, and `f6` through `f12`. Left Ctrl + Windows is the
recommended laptop combination. Two-key combinations wait briefly before
activation and are abandoned when a third key is pressed, preserving ordinary
Windows and application shortcuts. Right Alt remains unavailable because it is
AltGr on Norwegian keyboards. Letters, individual Windows or modifier keys,
and common editing keys are rejected. Microphones use `windows_default` or a
stable `portaudio:` identifier derived from the Windows audio host API and
device name. A device is resolved to its current PortAudio index when recording
begins, so stored indexes do not become stale.

Supported model identifiers are the packaged `tiny`, `base`, `small`, and
`medium` catalogue. Arbitrary repository names are rejected. Settings store
only the selected identifier; model files and integrity manifests remain under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Skrivi\models`.

## Validation and recovery

The current schema requires exactly the documented fields and validates their
types and basic safety constraints. Unknown fields are rejected. A missing file
uses defaults without a warning. Malformed JSON, missing fields, invalid values,
and unreadable files use defaults and return a short warning suitable for the
future interface.

Warnings never include the rejected value, file contents, or underlying
exception text. Skrivi Snakk preserves an invalid or newer-version file rather than
silently overwriting it.

## Migrations

Every document has an integer schema version. Migrations are applied in order in
memory before validation. Version 0 is the reserved unversioned prototype shape
and maps `language_mode`, `model_name`, and `show_overlay` to their version 1
equivalents. Version 1 documents migrate to version 2 without changing their
existing choices. Version 2 documents migrate to version 3, which restricts the
model field to Skrivi Snakk's trusted local catalogue. Version 3 documents migrate to
version 4 with automatic Windows interface-language selection. Version 4
documents migrate to version 5 with automatic startup disabled. Version 5
documents migrate to version 6, with the removed `multilingual` choice mapped
safely to restricted Automatic detection. Version 6 documents migrate to
version 7 without changing existing choices; version 7 adds the supported
laptop combinations.

A migrated document is written in the current format the next time settings are
explicitly saved. A schema newer than this Skrivi Snakk version is never downgraded or
overwritten automatically.

## Atomic writes

Saving writes a complete UTF-8 JSON document to a temporary file in the same
directory, flushes it to disk, and then replaces `settings.json` with
`os.replace`. If writing or replacement fails, the previous settings file is
left intact and the temporary file is removed on a best-effort basis.

Skrivi Snakk has a single-instance application model, so concurrent user-interface
writes are not supported or required.

## Current interface support

The v0.2 settings window can change dictation language, interface language,
microphone, push-to-talk key, speech model, overlay visibility, and automatic
startup. Dictation
language changes affect the next recording. Interface language changes are
previewed immediately and do not restart dictation or model activity.
Microphones are enumerated locally and validated before a selection becomes
active. Hotkey
capture accepts a deliberately small safe set and replaces the active global
listener before saving, with rollback if activation fails. These changes do not
require an application restart. The Models tab shows local installation state,
download size, RAM and CPU guidance, and controls for download, activation,
removal, and verified folder import.

## Privacy and offline operation

The settings schema contains only configuration values. It has no audio,
transcript, clipboard, history, telemetry, account, or remote-service fields.
The serializer writes only its explicit allowlist, and the loader rejects
unknown fields rather than retaining them.

Loading, validating, migrating, and saving settings perform no network access.
