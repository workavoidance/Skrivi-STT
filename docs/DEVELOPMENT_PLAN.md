# Skrivi Snakk development plan

## Shared interface implemented — 20 September 2026

- [x] Match Lytt's supporting navigation, settings sections, immediate saving,
  shortcut terminology, model actions, update checks, help and feedback.
- [x] Add a main dictation readiness/practice window and raise it on repeated launch.
- [x] Keep sign-in quiet, add indicator cancellation and persistent recovery.
- [x] Preserve user data and cover persistence failures and bilingual layouts.

See [shared UX details](SHARED_UX.md). Published signed installers remain unchanged;
these changes need the next versioned release and installed acceptance checks.

## Shared release convention — 20 September 2026

Snakk 0.3.0 and Lytt 0.4.1 use **Test release** and GitHub prerelease status.
Keep independent version numbers and stable app/Store identities. Match product
names, orange microphone/speaker icons, signed-installer guidance and direct
download/release links across GitHub and the bilingual website. Store packages
are maintainer uploads; Store approval is separate from GitHub publication.

## Naming update — 20 September 2026

The family is Skrivi; this app is Skrivi Snakk and its reading companion is
Skrivi Lytt. Current source and installer labels use these names. Published
downloads may still say Skrivi / Skrivi TTS. Preserve data folders, package
identities and existing release assets. Earlier entries retain historical wording.

This is the project's durable execution checklist and current source of truth
for development progress. Update it in the same pull request that completes or
changes an item. The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) describes intended releases; this
file records the work, its order, and its status.

## Product requirements that must remain true

- Skrivi is a local push-to-talk speech-to-text application for Windows 11.
- The default workflow is hold a key, speak, release, and insert the complete
  transcription wherever Windows accepts typing.
- English and Norwegian are first-class language requirements.
- Skrivi does not retain recordings or transcripts and does not use the
  clipboard for dictated text.
- Initial installation and user-requested model downloads may use the internet.
  Once setup is complete, every installed feature must keep working after the
  network is disconnected and Windows is restarted.
- Runtime use must not depend on telemetry, accounts, licence checks, update
  checks, or a remotely fetched model catalogue.
- Accessibility is an engineering requirement, while school or public-sector
  suitability must not be claimed without later independent evidence.

## Current position

**Current target:** v0.2, a configurable and accessible desktop application.

**Current engineering task:** Phase 8 distribution, publishing the tested
per-user installer as a clearly labelled v0.2 alpha and providing a direct,
bilingual website download. The remaining Phase 6 reliability checks and Phase
7 manual accessibility checks remain deferred and unchecked below.

The manual high-DPI, high-contrast, multi-display, and screen-reader checks for
issue [#8](https://github.com/workavoidance/Skrivi-STT/issues/8) are intentionally
deferred while issue #6 is built. They remain required in
[`UI_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`](UI_TEST_CHECKLIST.md) and do not block development.

The v0.2 tracking issue is
[#10](https://github.com/workavoidance/Skrivi-STT/issues/10).

  runtime network access.

## Phase 7: Norwegian interface

- [x] Translate the complete Skrivi interface into Norwegian Bokmål, including
  tray actions, settings, status messages, errors, model guidance, and
  accessibility labels.
- [x] Follow the Windows display language on first run and allow English or
  Norwegian to be selected explicitly in Settings.
- [x] Keep translations structured so additional interface languages can be
  added without changing application logic.
- [ ] Test both languages at high DPI, with keyboard navigation, and with a
  screen reader before the release candidate.

## Skrivi ecosystem and visual identity review

Added: 2026-09-19. Implementation prepared: 2026-09-20; awaiting Windows CI,
merge and a packaged release. Keep the acceptance items below unchecked until
the applicable verification and merge requirements are met.

The implementation uses an orange microphone rendered from one shared source
for the runtime, executable, installer and Store assets. Settings and tray labels
now say Dictation / Diktering, and About explains the companion reader with an
explicit browser link. Shared settings styling is retained: TTS already derives
its warm surfaces, rounded controls and orange palette from STT. Installation
and data identities stay unchanged. Shortcut guidance recommends Right Ctrl or
Left Ctrl + Windows to avoid overlap with the reader's Ctrl + Alt + Space.

Verification: 204 automated tests passed locally on Windows with Python 3.14;
formatting, lint and compilation passed. English and Norwegian settings/About
renders were inspected. See [ecosystem review](ECOSYSTEM_REVIEW.md) for scope,
screenshots and remaining packaged-installation/accessibility checks.

Skrivi now also has a text-to-speech application. Review the speech-to-text
application's identity and presentation so dictation feels like a natural
part of the same Skrivi ecosystem, while users can easily distinguish speaking
to write from listening to text.

- [ ] Compare the current STT and TTS applications side by side and identify
  shared visual conventions worth adopting.
- [ ] Explore a clearly recognisable microphone icon for the local dictation
  application, complementing the TTS application's speaker icon. Retain the
  existing orange colours and coordinate shape, stroke weight, and proportions.
- [ ] Review the executable, desktop shortcut, Start menu, taskbar, tray, and
  installer icons as one consistent set. Check legibility at small sizes,
  high DPI, and in light, dark, and high-contrast environments.
- [ ] Review product names, window titles, tray tooltips, and short descriptions
  so the shared Skrivi identity and each application's purpose are clear.
  Consider plain-language dictation/read-aloud labels in English and Norwegian
  rather than relying only on STT/TTS abbreviations.
- [ ] Review settings layout, typography, spacing, buttons, status indicators,
  and terminology for a coherent family appearance. Preserve accessible native
  Windows behaviour and distinguish recording from speech playback without
  relying on colour alone.
- [ ] Review About/help text, first-run guidance, website/download descriptions,
  and screenshots so they explain where dictation fits in the ecosystem and
  help users find the companion application.
- [ ] Review coexistence when both applications are installed: recognisable
  tray entries, clear shortcut guidance, and avoidance of hotkey conflicts.
- [ ] Record the agreed shared conventions and application-specific differences
  in the brand guidelines before implementation. Preserve the existing local,
  private dictation workflow and users' settings and downloaded models.

## Later credibility gates

These are recorded now so current decisions do not undermine them. They are not
claims about the present alpha.

- [ ] Establish repeatable Norwegian and English accuracy benchmarks.
- [ ] Publish representative school-laptop performance results.
- [ ] Conduct structured usability testing with people who have dyslexia.
- [ ] Obtain an independent accessibility evaluation.
- [ ] Add signed releases, managed-device packaging, an SBOM,
  and vulnerability scanning.
- [ ] Document the threat model, support policy, and vulnerability-response
  process.
- [ ] Obtain independent security and data-protection review before pursuing
  school or public-sector recommendations.

## Definition of done for every checklist item

An item is checked only when all applicable conditions are met:

1. The implementation and acceptance criteria agree.
2. Automated tests cover the important success and failure paths.
3. Windows CI passes.
4. User-facing behaviour and limitations are documented.
5. Privacy and offline-operation requirements remain intact.
6. A real Windows test is completed when hardware or operating-system behaviour
   cannot be adequately verified in automation.
7. The change is merged into `main`, and this checklist is updated in the same
   pull request or immediately afterward.
