# Windows interface acceptance checklist

Use this checklist on the portable pull-request build before merging a major
interface change. Record the Windows version, display arrangement, scaling,
theme, keyboard used, and result in the pull request.

## Deferred manual QA

This manual interface pass was deferred on 2026-09-01 so issue #6 development
could continue. Nothing below is considered complete by deferral. Run and
record the full checklist before the v0.2 release candidate, and before closing
issue #8.

## Bragi-to-Skrivi Snakk upgrade

- Before starting the renamed branch, confirm the current Bragi development
  build still shows the expected saved language, microphone, hotkey, overlay,
  and active model.
- Stop Bragi completely, switch to the rename branch, and start `dev.bat`.
- Confirm the tray, Settings window, accessibility labels, and status overlay
  show Skrivi Snakk, not Bragi or Whisper Dictate.
- Confirm the previous settings are still selected and the installed models are
  immediately available without another download or file copy.
- Confirm `%APPDATA%\Skrivi` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Skrivi` now contain the moved
  data and the corresponding Bragi directories no longer exist.
- Confirm an installed model contains `skrivi-model.json`, then perform a normal
  dictation and switch between two installed models.
- Build or download the portable preview and confirm the file is `Skrivi.exe`
  inside a `Skrivi-...-windows-x64.zip` archive.

## Core workflow

- Start Skrivi Snakk and confirm the tray status changes from loading to ready without
  freezing its menu.
- Hold Right Ctrl, speak, release it, and confirm the text is inserted exactly
  as before the interface change.
- Confirm recording and transcription continue while the Settings window is
  open.
- Exit from the tray during idle, then repeat during recording.
- Exit while Skrivi Snakk is transcribing and confirm no text is inserted afterward.
- Start a non-default model download, exit Skrivi Snakk, and confirm the process closes
  without hanging. Restart and confirm the cancelled model is not installed and
  can be downloaded normally.
- In Settings, confirm the language choices are Automatic, Norwegian, and
  English in that order. Confirm Automatic selects only Norwegian or English,
  and that the next recording uses each new choice without a restart.
- Select an available microphone, save, and dictate without restarting. Then
  disconnect it and confirm the next dictation temporarily uses Windows Default.
  Reconnect it and confirm Skrivi Snakk automatically returns to the selection.
- With Windows Default selected, change the default input in Windows Sound
  settings and confirm the next dictation uses the new default without restarting.
- Disconnect a microphone during a recording and confirm that recording is
  discarded, Skrivi Snakk returns to Ready, and the next dictation can start normally.
- Change the push-to-talk key, confirm the old key no longer records, and confirm
  the new key records exactly once per press. Restore Right Ctrl afterward.
- Select Left Ctrl + Windows and Left Ctrl + Left Alt in either press order.
  Confirm each starts only after a deliberate short hold and stops when either
  key is released.
- While each laptop combination is selected, confirm common three-key Windows
  shortcuts still work without starting dictation. Confirm Right Alt/AltGr does
  not activate the Left Ctrl + Left Alt choice on a Norwegian keyboard. Confirm
  the Start menu does not open after a Left Ctrl + Windows dictation.
- Dictate Norwegian text containing `æ`, `ø`, and `å` after each configuration
  change and confirm direct insertion is still correct.
- Open Models and confirm Tiny, Base, Small, and Medium show download size, RAM
  guidance, CPU suitability, and clear installed or not-installed state.
- Download Base and confirm its name, downloaded size, total size, percentage,
  and separate verification stage remain visible. Cancel once, confirm Base is
  not offered as installed, then download it fully, activate it, and dictate
  without restarting Skrivi. Confirm Small can then be restored.
- Interrupt a non-default model download by exiting Skrivi. Restart and confirm
  the partial model is not offered as installed and can be downloaded again.
- Copy an installed non-active model folder to another location, remove it in
  Skrivi Snakk, import the copied folder, and confirm it passes verification.
- Disconnect the network, restart Windows, switch between two installed models,
  and dictate successfully with both.
- Make the selected model temporarily unavailable before startup and confirm
  the tray offers **Retry speech model**. Restore the model, retry, and confirm
  Skrivi Snakk reaches Ready without restarting. Confirm repeated clicks do not start
  overlapping loads.
- After a simulated transcription failure, confirm the recording is discarded,
  Skrivi Snakk returns to Ready, and the next normal dictation succeeds.

## Installer and automatic startup

- Download the installer preview and confirm Windows identifies it as an
  unsigned development build before proceeding.
- Install without administrator approval. Confirm Skrivi Snakk appears in the Start
  menu, Apps list, and standard uninstall list.
- Confirm Skrivi Snakk starts after installation and reaches Ready.
- Enable **Start Skrivi Snakk automatically when I sign in**, save, restart Windows,
  and confirm exactly one tray instance starts.
- Disable the setting, restart Windows, and confirm Skrivi Snakk does not start.
- Install a newer preview over the existing copy. Confirm settings, installed
  models, and the automatic-startup choice remain intact.
- Uninstall Skrivi. Confirm the application and shortcuts are removed while
  `%APPDATA%\Skrivi` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Skrivi\models` remain available for a
  later reinstall.
- Run the portable executable from a permanent folder, enable automatic
  startup, and restart Windows. Confirm it starts from that folder. Disable the
  setting before moving or deleting the portable executable.

## Keyboard and assistive access

- Open the tray menu from the Windows notification area using only the
  keyboard, then open Settings and exit Skrivi.
- In Settings, use Tab, Shift+Tab, arrow keys, tab mnemonics and
  Escape. Confirm every action has a visible focus indicator.
- With Windows Narrator, confirm the window, tabs, overlay option, Close,
  language, microphone, hotkey controls, status text, and any settings warning
  have useful names.
- Confirm loading, ready, listening, transcribing, no-speech and error states
  are understandable without relying on colour.

## English and Norwegian interface

- With the interface language set to Automatic, change the Windows display
  language between English and Norwegian where practical, restart Skrivi Snakk, and
  confirm the matching interface is selected.
- Switch between English and Norsk bokmål in Settings. Confirm the open Settings
  window, tray, overlay, model status, and accessibility labels update
  immediately without restarting Skrivi. Confirm each language remains
  self-named in both pickers.
- Change the interface language, choose Close, reopen Settings, and confirm the
  new language remains selected. Simulate an unwritable settings file and confirm
  the previous choice is restored with a visible explanation.
- Switch the interface language during an active model download and during
  dictation. Confirm the visible progress or status updates without interrupting
  either operation.
- Restart after saving an explicit choice and confirm it still overrides the
  Windows display language.
- In Norwegian, review the tray, every Settings tab, model details, download and
  verification progress, cancellation, microphone recovery, model errors, and
  status overlay. Confirm no user-facing English remains except model names,
  product names, and technical file names.
- Repeat keyboard navigation and Narrator checks in both interface languages.
- At 100%, 150%, and 200% text scaling, confirm the longer Norwegian labels and
  messages are not clipped.

## Display and theme matrix

- Test Windows text scaling at 100%, 150% and 200%. Confirm no text is clipped.
- Test Windows high-contrast mode and both normal light and dark application
  themes. Confirm text, focus and disabled controls remain legible.
- Test two displays with different scaling. Put the pointer on each display,
  dictate, and confirm the overlay stays inside that display's work area.
- Repeat with the second display positioned left of and above the primary
  display, covering negative desktop coordinates.
- Open Settings on each display and confirm its size and controls scale cleanly.

## Privacy and offline behaviour

- Confirm preview mode does not request microphone access or load a model.
- After the model is installed, disconnect the network, restart Windows, and
  confirm normal dictation, Settings and the tray still work.
- Confirm no recording, transcript or dictated text appears in the settings
  file or application directory.
